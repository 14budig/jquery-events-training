# Events Lab
It's important that you understand how to use events in your code. The following exercises will let you play with some of the more common ones.

#ready
- Can you get the page to say "Go!"?

#submit
- Can you stop the forms from submitting?
    + Why does one refresh and the other redirect?
    + What is the "?" doing in the URL?
- Bonus: Instead of redirecting to youtube, let's embed the video in our page instead!
    +  When the user clicks "submit", dynamically insert the embed code into the page (on youtube, click "share" under the video, then click "embed" and copy the html). HINT: The embed code belongs in your javascript, not your html!

#change
- Some simple addition! Can you get the total to update whenever you update the numbers?
- Bonus: Can you create a "reset" button that clears all the inputs?
- Stretch: Can you create a "log" or "receipt" of all calculations? (Hint: you might consider using an unordered list).

#click
- Can you log all the phrases that are clicked?
- Stretch: New phrases.
    + Create a form that allows users to dynamically add phrases to the page.
        * Watch out that they still log when they're clicked!

#keypress
- Simple timer: When the user hits spacebar, record their "start" time. When they  hit it again, record their "end" time. Then, calculate the total time, and put it on the page.
- Stretch goals:
    + If the user hits the spacebar a third time, the timer should start again.
    + Add a way for the user to reset the timer.
    + Display an actual timer/counter that updates every second.

#Wrap it up
- Recommended: Create a navbar at the top of every page, with links to all the other pages.
