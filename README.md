# Training: DOM Events & jQuery

In the following exercises you will practice with five of the most common DOM `events` in jQuery:
- ready
- submit
- change
- click
- keypress

You can find a full list of `event` related methods in jQuery here: http://api.jquery.com/category/events/

## Instructions:

Fork this repository to your GitHub account, then clone your GitHub copy onto your computer.

* Each event has its own HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files collected in a directory.  Start by opening the HTML file for that directory in your browser.
* Read the descriptions below and the existing HTML and JavaScript for each event type. You'll need to change each `base.js` file. Do not change the HTML files.
* Make sure to keep your developer console open so that you can check for bugs!
* Make at least one commit for step below.

###1. ready

**Get the page to say "Go!" without touching the html.**

###2. submit

**Stop the forms from submitting.**

+ That's weird. Why does one button reload the same page and the other redirect to youtube?  

+ Hmm... What is the "?" doing in the URL? How did it get there? Try removing it.  

Stretch: Instead of just stopping the forms, make it so that clicking the submit buttons adds an embeds youtube video to the page.

###3. change

**Addition! Get the total to update whenever you update the numbers.**

Stretch: Add a "reset" button that clears all the inputs.

###4. click

**Create a list of all the phrases that are clicked.**

Stretch: In addition to listing the phrase I clicked, can you include a timestamp?

###5. keypress

**Make a stop watch!**

When the user hits spacebar, record their "start" time.

When they hit it again, record their "end" time.

Then, calculate the total time, and put it on the page.

###6. Wrap it Up

Recommended: Can you link all the pages together? Create a `<nav>` element on every page, with links to all the other pages.

## Deliverable

When you wrap up work, edit this README to include your name, a link to the original repository, and a 3-5 sentence reflection on completing this assignment.

Push your updates to GitHub and add a link to the repo to the "My Work" section of your website!
